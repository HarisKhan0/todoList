## Project Description

ListIt is an intuitive todo list application for students and young professionals. The application has unique features like priority assignment for tasks, color coordination, and grouping settings. ListIt provides users with a form to create new items, a table view of their upcoming tasks, and a weekly view to more easily visualize upcoming deadlines. Unlike notion or the notes app, ListIt is focused around crafting a central user experience that is unique to each user and their respective tasks.
